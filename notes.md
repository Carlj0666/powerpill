# About Powerpill
I am building this PacMan style game just to get some more practice in with coordinates in relation to an array (traversing indices and widths in this case ), a bit of logic and also just for fun.

Aftermath: This ended up being way more involved in terms of, well everything. This wasn't as simple as traversing an array which was really only the basis for the gameboard. Movement logic becam key for decision making as once the board was drawn, the wraiths needd to move freely without breaking rules. Also, rules needed to change based on certain conditions being met (i.e freaked out wraiths (powerpill induced fear) which was fun.

## To Do
?)

## Features to consider
0) Better wraiths (not rando movement)
1) Latching movement?
X) Music!
3) Sound FX
4) Level generator!
5) actual pixel art? hmm.
