# Power mmm Pill
I am building this PacMan style game just to get some more practice in with coordinates in relation to an array (traversing indices and widths in this case ), a bit of logic and also just for fun.

I'd love to incorporate some sound into this, perhaps based on movement, or some other triggers, we'll see.
