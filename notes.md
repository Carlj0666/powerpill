# About Powerpill
I am building this PacMan style game just to get some more practice in with coordinates in relation to an array (traversing indices and widths in this case ), a bit of logic and also just for fun.

I'd love to incorporate some sound into this, perhaps based on movement, or some other triggers, we'll see.

## To Do
1) Remove dots on overlap
2) Make "scariess"
3) scaries behavior
4) Powerpill effects
5) scaries busting



## Features to consider
1) Latching movement?
2) Music!
3) Sound FX
4) Level generator
