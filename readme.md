# About Powerpill:
I am building this PacMan style game just to get some more practice in with coordinates in relation to an array (traversing indices and widths in this case ), a bit of logic and also just for fun. This was built in JS, HTML, CSS, NODE JS / Express.
This was create with the help of online tutorials, lots of documentation research etc. 

# Play:
The game starts on load, but the Wraiths can be a bit reluctant to leave their haunt, which gives one a little time to start exploring (enough to hit play to listen to the music below!) Use the arrow keys to move. Once a pill is consumed, the hallway goes dark. It's visible, but barely. Powerpills make the Wraiths taste good, but they can't always be consumed on the first pass. 

# Aftermath: 
This ended up being way more involved in terms of, well everything. This wasn't as simple as traversing an array which was really only the basis for the gameboard. Movement logic became key for decision making as once the board was drawn, the wraiths need to move freely without breaking rules. Also, rules needed to change based on certain conditions being met (i.e freaked out wraiths (powerpill induced fear) which was fun.

# Addendum:
I am seeing some odd behavior in terms of the Pill Consumer not always consuming the wraiths when passing over. I rather like the unexpected nature of this play style so I may leave it as an interesting quirk.


## Features to consider:
0) Better wraiths (not rando movement) SEE APP2.js for commented out logic notes, experimentation.
1) Latching movement?
X) Music!
3) Sound FX
4) Level generator!
5) actual pixel art? hmm.
6) Add mobile touch controls
